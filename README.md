# dotfiles

A simple dotfile config for setting up a new system.

## Installation

To get started, just run ./install.sh, and it should create most of the symlinks to get up and running

## Warning

This is very much a work in progress and isn't really meant to be branched, or whatever. You're welcome to steal any ideas from me, just like I stole a bunch of the ideas for this repo from other people, just don't expect it to work.
